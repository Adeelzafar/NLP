            "['ISLAMABAD (92 News) – Jamaat-e-Islami ameer Sirajul Haq said that the people had demanded factories, but the government established \\'langarkhanas\\'. Addressing a congregation in Islamabad on Saturday, he said that PM Imran Khan is pleased after seeing long queues at \\'langarkhanas\\'. \"The government should have given jobs to only one thousand youths if it was not possible for 10 million people,\" he maintained. The JI ameer said that the people getting loan for construction of houses should not return the interest. \"The real reason for the economic destruction is corrupt rulers and interest system. Pakistan and the interest system cannot go side by side,\" he added. He said that no government decides about elimination of interest. \"Nawaz Sharif had promised to end interest, but later he backtracked from his promise. The Islamic economic system is a reality and today the Islamic system is the need of hour,\" he maintained. Sirajul Haq said that the country cannot make progress in the presence of the present government. \"Pakistan has surplus electricity. Why are the power rates increased,\" he added.', 'LAHORE (92 News) – Federal Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar has said that the government knows that the inflation has increased in the country. Addressing a ceremony on Saturday, he said that about 200 countries, not only Pakistan, are affected by the inflation. \"The opposition wants to gain popularity and does not tell the nation about the reality,\" he added. The minister was of the view that India was also facing a historic inflation. \"Had we closed business during the coronavirus the inflation would have been three times in the country,\" he maintained. He said that the inflation in the country will subside after its decrease in the world. \"The government had given billions of rupees to the people during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also giving the health cards to the people and each family will be able to get treatment up to Rs one million per year,\" he added.', 'ISLAMABAD (92 News) – The Center for Governance Research, an organization, has declared Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Athar Minallah the Person of the Year for his bold and principled stance about the missing persons.  The IHC chief justice had held the executive and the federal cabinet responsible for the missing persons. The Center for Governance Research demanded immediate promulgation of legislation dealing with enforced disappearances. \"The missing persons issue should be addressed as top agenda for achieving good governance,\" it demanded.', 'KARACHI (92 News) – The Pakistan People\\'s Party (PPP) has released a white paper on the bad performance of the government. Addressing a press conference along with Naveed Qamar and Faisal Karim Kundi on Saturday, PPP leader Shazia Marri said that economy had destroyed, investment reduced while inflation and unemployment have been increased. She said that the foreign investment had reduced by 31 percent. \"The inflation has touched the double digit. PM Imran Khan often gives examples of India where foreign investment has increased by 27 percent,\" he maintained. Shazia Marri said that the PTI had unemployed the people after promising to give them employment. In total, 6.6 million Pakistanis have been made jobless. Unemployment is at four percent and 10.3 percent in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, respectively. She said that destruction had been caused in the country in the name of change. \"Imran Khan says that the government will bring the circular debt to zero, but today our trade deficit is at Rs30.7 billion. Pakistan is the fourth costly country in the wold,\" she maintained.', 'KARACHI (92 News) – Finance Ministry Spokesperson Muzammil Aslam has said that the prices of items of use of common man have not been increased in the mini-budget. Talking to the media on Saturday, he said that the government will not export sugar this year. \"The growth rate has been at four percent in the FY 2021. The country received the record production of rice, wheat, maize and sugarcane,\" he added. The spokesperson said that the government would collect the tax revenue of Rs6,100 billion this year. \"The prices of food items have increased across the world, but now stability in the prices will be witnessed,\" he maintained. He said that the rates of potatoes, onions and tomatoes have reduced. \"However, the prices of POL products have been increased, but they are Rs1 less than the prices on November 5,\" he added. Muzammil Aslam said that the bad effect on the prices was witnessed due to a sudden increase in the prices of raw oil. \"The IMF had asked to impose the tax of Rs700 billion. We collected only Rs2,920 billion in six months,\" he disclosed. He said that the tax had been imposed on branded imported items.', 'CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - President Cyril Ramaphosa lauded the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu as \"our moral compass and national conscience\" as South Africa bade farewell at a state funeral on Saturday to a hero of the struggle against apartheid. \"Our departed father was a crusader in the struggle for freedom, for justice, for equality and for peace, not just in South Africa, the country of his birth, but around the world,\" Ramaphosa said, delivering the main eulogy at the service in St George\\'s Cathedral, Cape Town, where for years Tutu preached against racial injustice. The president then handed over the national flag to Tutu\\'s widow, Nomalizo Leah, known as \"Mama Leah\". Tutu, who was awarded the Nobel Peace prize in 1984 for his non-violent opposition to white minority rule, died last Sunday aged 90. His widow sat in a wheelchair in the front row of the congregation, draped in a purple scarf, the colour of her husband\\'s clerical robes. Ramaphosa wore a matching necktie. Cape Town, the city where Tutu lived for most of his later life, was unseasonably rainy early on Saturday as mourners gathered to bid farewell to the man fondly known as \"The Arch\". The sun shone brightly after the requiem Mass as six white-robed clergy acting as pall bearers wheeled the coffin out of the cathedral to a hearse. Tutu\\'s body will be cremated and then his ashes interred behind the cathedral\\'s pulpit in a private ceremony. \"Small in physical stature, he was a giant among us morally and spiritually,\" said retired Bishop Michael Nuttall, who served as Tutu\\'s deputy for many years. Life-size posters of Tutu, with his hands clasped, were placed outside the cathedral, where the number of congregants was restricted in line with COVID-19 measures. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who leads the global Anglican Communion, said in a recorded message: \"People have said \\'when we were in the dark, he brought light\\' and that... has lit up countries globally that are struggling with fear, conflicts, persecution, oppression.\" Tutu\\'s family members were visibly emotional. His daughter, Reverend Nontombi Naomi Tutu, thanked well-wishers for their support as the Mass began, her voice briefly quivering with emotion. \\'RAINBOW NATION\\' Widely revered across South Africa\\'s racial and cultural divides for his moral integrity, Tutu never stopped fighting for his vision of a \"Rainbow Nation\" in which all races in post-apartheid South Africa could live in harmony. Hundreds of well-wishers queued on Thursday and Friday to pay their last respects as his body lay in state at the cathedral. As Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, Tutu turned St George\\'s into what is known as a \"People\\'s Cathedral\" a refuge for anti-apartheid activists during the turbulent 1980s and 1990s when security forces brutally repressed the mass democratic movement. A small crowd of around 100 people followed the funeral proceedings on a big screen at the Grand Parade, opposite City Hall where Tutu joined Nelson Mandela when he gave his first speech after being freed from prison. “We have come to give our last respects to our father Tutu. We love our father, who taught us about love, unity and respect for one another,” said Mama Phila, a 54-year-old Rastafarian draped in the green, red and yellow colours of her faith. Mandela, who became the country\\'s first post-apartheid president and who died in December 2013, once said of his friend: \"Sometimes strident, often tender, never afraid and seldom without humour, Desmond Tutu\\'s voice will always be the voice of the voiceless.\"', 'KIEV (AFP) – Ukraine said Saturday one of its soldiers was killed in fighting with pro-Moscow separatists, as the US again warned Russia against any attacks on the country. US President Joe Biden was due to speak to his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, after warning Russian President Vladimir Putin for the second time of a tough response should he invade Ukraine. In his New Year\\'s Eve address, Zelensky said ending the war in the east remains his \"main goal\". \"One serviceman of the Joint Forces was fatally wounded,\" the army said in a statement, adding that separatists had launched three attacks within 24 hours, using grenade launchers and small arms. The army gave no further details of how the soldier was killed. Tensions with Moscow have soared in recent months, with Russia massing troops near Ukraine\\'s borders. The West has accused the Kremlin of planning an invasion. This week, Biden held his second phone call with Putin in just over three weeks, threatening Moscow with major economic sanctions should it launch an attack. The Russian leader said anti-Moscow sanctions would be a \"colossal mistake\". On December 22 international monitors said Russia and Ukraine had agreed to restore a ceasefire, but as early as the next day Kiev and separatists accused each other of new violations. The soldier\\'s death on Saturday was the first since the truce was agreed. All previous ceasefires -- including the previous truce agreed in July 2020 -- crumbled. Kiev has been battling a pro-Moscow insurgency\\xa0 in two breakaway regions bordering Russia since 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has so far left more than 13,000 dead.', 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and the head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday asked AT&T and Verizon Communications to delay the planned Jan. 5 introduction of new 5G wireless service over aviation safety concerns۔ In a letter Friday seen by Reuters, Buttigieg and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson asked AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey and Verizon Chief Executive Hans Vestberg for a delay of no more than two weeks as part of a \"proposal as a near-term solution for advancing the co-existence of 5G deployment in the C-Band and safe flight operations.\" The aviation industry and FAA have raised concerns about potential interference of 5G with sensitive aircraft electronics like radio altimeters that could disrupt flights. \"We ask that your companies continue to pause introducing commercial C-Band service for an additional short period of no more than two weeks beyond the currently scheduled deployment date of January 5,\" the letter says. Verizon and AT&T both said they received the letter and were reviewing it. Earlier Friday the two companies accused the aerospace industry of seeking to hold C-Band spectrum deployment \"hostage until the wireless industry agrees to cover the costs of upgrading any obsolete altimeters.\" Buttigieg and Dickson said under the framework \"commercial C-band service would begin as planned in January with certain exceptions around priority airports.\" The FAA and the aviation industry would identify priority airports \"where a buffer zone would permit aviation operations to continue safely while the FAA completes its assessments of the interference potential.\" The government would work to identify \"mitigations for all priority airports\" to enable most \"large commercial aircraft to operate safely in all conditions.\" That would allow deployment around \"priority airports on a rolling basis\" -- aiming to ensure activation by March 31 barring unforeseen issues. The carriers, which won the spectrum in an $80 billion government auction, previously agreed to precautionary measures for six months to limit interference. On Thursday, trade group Airlines for America asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to halt deployment of new 5G wireless service around many airports, warning thousands of flights could be disrupted: \"The potential damage to the airline industry alone is staggering.\" Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, representing 50,000 flight attendants at 17 airlines, called the Transportation Department proposal \"the right move to successfully implement 5G without using the traveling public (and the crews on their flights) as guinea pigs for two systems that need to coexist without questions for safety.\" Wireless industry group CTIA said 5G is safe and spectrum is being used in about 40 other countries. House Transportation Committee chair Peter DeFazio Friday backed the airline group petition warning \"we can’t afford to experiment with aviation safety.\"', 'KARACHI (92 News) – The authorities enforced a micro-smart lockdown in Gulshan Iqbal Block 7 after 11 cases of Corona Omicron variant were reported on Saturday.

Brent crude futures settled down $1.75, or 2.2%, at $77.78 a barrel. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dropped $1.78, or 2.31%, to $75.21 a barrel. Brent ended the year up 50.5%, its biggest gain since 2016, while WTI posted a 55.5% gain, the strongest performance for the benchmark contract since 2009, when prices soared more than 70%. Both contracts touched their 2021 peak in October, with Brent at $86.70 a barrel, the highest since 2018, and WTI at $85.41 a barrel, the highest since 2014. \"This year was a story of global recovery for petroleum products,\" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. \"The oil market continues to be highly reactive to developments on the pandemic front - we\\'re not out of the woods yet, but we are close to pre-pandemic demand levels.\" Global oil prices are expected to rise further next year as jet fuel demand catches up. \"We\\'ve had Delta and Omicron and all manner of lockdowns and travel restrictions, but demand for oil has remained relatively firm,\" said Australian brokerage firm CommSec\\'s Chief Economist Craig James. \"You can attribute that to the effects of stimulus supporting demand and restrictions on supply.\" However, after rising for several straight days, oil prices stalled on Friday as COVID-19 cases soared to new pandemic highs across the globe, from Australia to the United States, stoked by the highly transmissible Omicron coronavirus variant. U.S. health experts warned Americans to prepare for severe disruptions in coming weeks, with infection rates likely to worsen amid increased holiday travel, New Year celebrations and school reopenings following winter breaks. A Reuters survey of 35 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude would average $73.57 a barrel in 2022, about 2% lower than the $75.33 consensus in November. It is the first reduction in the 2022 price forecast since the August poll. Easing production outages in Nigeria and Ecuador weighed on prices earlier this week. With oil hovering near $80, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and allies - together called OPEC+ - will probably stick to their plan to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply in February when they meet on Jan. 4, four sources said.', 'MELBOURNE (Reuters) - US Open champion Emma Raducanu has withdrawn from this week\\'s Australian Open warm-up tournament having just come out of isolation after testing positive for COVID-19, she said on Saturday. Raducanu, who became the first qualifier to win a Grand Slam when she triumphed at Flushing Meadows in September, had pulled out of the Mubadala World Tennis Championship exhibition event in Abu Dhabi last month after contracting the virus. The 19-year-old was scheduled to headline one of the two women\\'s WTA 250 warm-up tournaments taking place at Melbourne Park -- dubbed the \\'Melbourne Summer Set\\' -- from Jan. 4-9. \"The timing to compete in the first Melbourne event this week is too soon for me, having just returned from isolation,\" Raducanu was quoted as saying by the organisers. The world number 19 is scheduled to compete in the Sydney Classic later this month before making her debut in the Jan. 17-30 Australian Open.', 'SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un capped off his 10th year in power with a speech that made more mention of tractor factories and school uniforms than nuclear weapons or the United States, according to summaries by state media on Saturday. North Korea\\'s main goals for 2022 will be jump starting economic development and improving people\\'s lives as it faces a \"great life-and-death struggle,\" Kim said in a speech on Friday at the end of the 4th Plenary Meeting of the 8th Central Committee of the Workers\\' Party of Korea (WPK), which began on Monday. The meetings coincided with the 10-year anniversary of Kim effectively assuming leadership of the country after the death of his father in 2011. Kim has used previous speeches around the New Year to make major policy announcements, including launching significant diplomatic engagements with South Korea and the United States. But summaries of his speech published in North Korean state media made no specific mention of the United States, with only a passing reference to unspecified discussions of inter-Korean relations and \"external affairs.\" The domestic focus of the speech underscored the economic problems Kim faces at home, where self-imposed anti-pandemic border lockdowns have left North Korea more isolated than ever before, with international aid organisations warning of possible food shortages and a humanitarian crisis. \"The main task facing our Party and people next year is to provide a sure guarantee for the implementation of the five-year plan and bring about a remarkable change in the state development and the people\\'s standard of living,\" Kim was quoted as saying. Kim spent the majority of his speech detailing domestic issues from an ambitious plan for rural development to people\\'s diets, school uniforms and the need to crack down on \"non-socialist practices.\" The big focus on rural development is likely a populist strategy, said Chad O\\'Carroll, founder of NK News, a Seoul-based website that tracks North Korea. \"Overall, Kim might be aware that revealing sophisticated military development plans while people are suffering food shortages and harsh conditions outside of Pyongyang might not be such a good idea this year,\" he wrote on Twitter. Saturday\\'s state media report cited the development of \"one ultra-modern weapon system after another\" as a major achievement of the past year and said Kim called for bolstering the national defence to face an unstable international situation. A tractor factory he discussed in the speech was likely used to build launch vehicles for missiles, foreign analysts have said, and North Korea is believed to have expanded its arsenal despite the lockdowns. The reports of Kim\\'s speech did not mention the United States\\' call for denuclearisation talks, or South Korea\\'s push for a declaration to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War as a way to restart those negotiations. North Korea has previously said it is open to diplomacy, but that the American overtures appear hollow while \"hostile acts\" such as military drills and sanctions continue.', 'SRINAGAR (KMS): In Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir, Indian troops in their unabated acts of state terrorism martyred 210 innocent Kashmiris including five women and five young boys during the year 2021.
